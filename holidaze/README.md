  If the user is not logged in they can browse the venues and search for venues. But they wont be able to book a venue or see profile.

- A logged in user may see their own profile page where they can change profile picture, see their username, mail, and venue manager status. Display their bookings.

- This project were focused on being user-friendly and easy to navigate and have working functions rather than design.
